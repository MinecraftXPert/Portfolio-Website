    title: "Economy Bot",
    description:
      "A verified discord bot that was originally created as a mini-economy for one server but later on it got so popular people asked me if they could add it to their servers. So after some adjusting, it is now in 100 servers. It's a mini economy bot that allows you to have a thriving economy in your server. It has a server leaderboard, a fake crypto, betting, jobs, etc. For now it uses prefix commands but I will eventually make it use slash commands and have a better database. This was made with discord.js and hosted on github.",

    title: "Gambling Dog Simulator",
    description:
      "This was one of my final projects I had done in college. It's a gambling simulator where you bet on a dog and each dog has a different percentage chance of winning. You can also see your balance, withdraw or deposit money into your account, check the result of previous races, etc. It uses user input in the terminal. This project was made using the C programming language.",
